# Covid_Data_Exploration
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 datasets using SQL. It showcases how to extract meaningful insights about infections, deaths, vaccinations, and trends globally.

ðŸ“„ Project Overview

    File: COVID Data Exploration.sql

    Goal: Perform data exploration and generate useful insights from COVID-19 data stored in a relational database.

    Key Focus Areas:

        Analyzing total cases and deaths per country.

        Identifying death rates and infection percentages.

        Comparing infection rates across countries relative to their populations.

        Exploring vaccination trends globally.

        Aggregating total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

ðŸ“š Dataset

    Source:
    Public COVID-19 datasets from sources like Our World In Data or Kaggle.

    Typical Columns Used:

        location

        date

        population

        total_cases

        total_deaths

        new_cases

        new_deaths

        total_vaccinations

        people_vaccinated

        people_fully_vaccinated

ðŸ›  SQL Techniques Used

    Aggregations: SUM(), MAX(), AVG()

    Window Functions: OVER (PARTITION BY ...)

    Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

    Joins across tables

    Conditional filtering: WHERE, HAVING

    Data type conversions and calculations

    Ranking countries based on metrics

ðŸš€ How to Run

    Load your COVID-19 dataset into a SQL Server database (or your preferred SQL database).

    Open the COVID Data Exploration.sql file in your SQL editor (like SSMS or Azure Data Studio).

    Execute the queries step-by-step to perform the analysis.

ðŸ“¢ Important Notes

    Some queries use window functions â€” ensure your SQL version supports them.

    It's assumed that NULL values in important columns (like cases, deaths) are handled before running analysis for accuracy.

    Visualizations (optional) can be built based on the results using Power BI, Tableau, or Python/Excel.

âœ¨ Potential Future Work

    Build a COVID-19 dashboard based on the explored data.

    Automate the analysis for daily updates using scheduled SQL jobs or cloud pipelines.

    Extend the analysis to continent-level or regional trends.
